With this project we intend to make an mobile app, whose purpose is to awake the user at a given time which was previously set. The major difference with this app, would be the use of games/quizes/math problems, aiming towards the use of active rational thought for the solving, which in turn would bring the user to na somewhat an awaken state (results may vary according to the user sleepness or will to remain asleep). That being said, the difference lies in the inability to turn off the alarm unless it is by solving the given game/quiz/math problem which the user is presented with.
